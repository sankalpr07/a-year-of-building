# 52 Weeks of AI-assisted Coding 

**Goal:**  
Build 52 projects in 52 weeks while transitioning from AI-assisted coding  
to complete independent software development.

---

##  Rules
- Early weeks: AI allowed as mentor, not code generator
- Mid phase: AI only for debugging & explanations
- Final phase: No AI usage
- Every project must include a reflection

---

##  Why?
To learn by building, failing, rebuilding — and mastering fundamentals.

---

##  Structure
Each week contains:
- Problem statement
- Source code
- Reflection & learnings
